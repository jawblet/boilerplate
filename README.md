# MERN boilerplate app with auth
 

This is an Express server meant to be used with a MongoDB database and React FE. The client is inside the folder called `React`. 

The env variables needed can be found in the .env.dist folder. 

This boilerplate has the server configured, and APIs/interfaces for authentication (login and registration for users with email, username, and password).
